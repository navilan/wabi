#+title: Tasks

* Bugs
** DONE Emacs & Yabai (moot if emacs on Nixos works as well)
+Right now emacs is not managed by Yabai. Full-screen emacs is almost like a VM and I deal with it the same way :D+
Turns out I forgot to uncomment an emacs include.
** DONE Font management (Git Crypt / Rsync.net)
Use ~requireFile~ for now.
** TODO Wallpaper management
** TODO UTM Window resize for tall screens
** TODO Dotfiles Documentation
** TODO Evil + vterm
** TODO Remove homebrew dependency
* Features
** TODO Yabai + Emacs:  https://gist.github.com/ethan-leba/760054f36a2f7c144c6b06ab6458fae6
** TODO Tmux + Emacs:  https://gist.github.com/mislav/5189704
** HOLD deploy-rs integration
This kinda works FWIW. Requires a nixos host system to test it to completion. Can try this later on the VM to see how this works.
** TODO UTM multi-display update
** TODO Wireshark
** TODO Tailscale / Headscale
* Machines and Home Automation
** TODO PI hole
** TODO Home Assistant
